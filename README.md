## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer who likes to work with Javascript. Always picking up new interests and project ideas. Currently school takes up a lot of my time.

I'm very active on Twitter. Consider giving a follow if you like Javascript jokes/design.

Alternatively, I'm probably online on Discord. Maybe I'm working on something right now!
